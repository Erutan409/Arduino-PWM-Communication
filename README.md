# Arduino-PWM-Communication
Arduino library for enabling communication directly between Arduino devices over long distances.

## Purpose
Allows the use of media, such as CAT5, for transferring data over reasonably long distances within a closed circuit.

## Goal
Enable developing of projects that need a method for communication with other Arduino devices, but doesn't require specialized shields that need to run on top of specific protocols; **TCP**, for example.

## Why

* Learning basic concepts of communication protocols and how to engineer them
* Cut costs on developing projects that require communication between devices
